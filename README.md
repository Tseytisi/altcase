# AltCase

> JTC, April 2023

Simple tool for converting text to alternating case. aLLoWiNg YoU tO EaSiLy wRiTe LiKe tHiS.

Works as both a command-line program, and as GUI application.

Has a mode that ensures all occurrences of 'i' are lowercase, and all occurrences of 'L' are uppercase, to avoid confusion.

### Upcoming features
- Allow input through pipe
- Split input on newlines so each line gets the best mapping (in normal conversion mode)
- Start with capital or non-capital letter in simple mode depending on the first character
- GUI: Copied-to-clipboard notifier
